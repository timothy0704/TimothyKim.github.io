 <div class="info">
  <p>Black History Month was created to focus attention on the contributions of African Americans to the United States. It honors all black people from all periods of American history, from the first slaves brought from Africa in the early 17th century to the African Americans living in the country today.</p>
 </div>
  <h3 id = "Why is">Why is black history month in Febuary</h3>
